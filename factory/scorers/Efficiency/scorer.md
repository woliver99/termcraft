**Rubric**

Evaluate the agent's trajectory to reach the result: the steps the agent took, rework it caused elsewhere in the loop, and human attention it consumed. Score against what a competent engineer with the same tools would have needed, not against what was achievable with only what the agent happened to have. A mistake that looks unavoidable in context still counts if better tooling, a skill, or a check would have prevented it — name that cause in the reason. The bullets below are common sources of waste, not an exhaustive checklist — judge any other way the run cost more than it should have.

Assess:

- **Rework from mistakes.** Work redone because the agent got it wrong the first time: a review or CI failure a local check would have caught, edits to the wrong file, a misread requirement later reverted.
- **Iteration cycles.** In a coordinating run, the round trips needed to reach an acceptable result — repeated implement-and-review cycles, work bounced back for the same defect. Attribute the cost to this run where its own choices caused it: an underspecified brief, unchecked acceptance of work, not passing forward what a prior cycle established.
- **Cost to the human.** Repeated correction or steering from the user is the most expensive waste. A question asked up front is cheap; the same question asked after building the wrong thing is not.
- **Information gathering.** Re-reading, re-running, or re-searching for something already found; reading a large file end to end when a targeted search would answer it.
- **Routine-step overhead.** A roundabout way of doing something that's a standard, repeated part of this agent's job — more steps, more calls, or a broader operation than the step needs — when a more direct path was available. Weight this beyond its one-run cost: the same avoidable overhead recurs on every future run of the same type until the pattern is fixed.
- **Batching.** Independent reads, searches, or workstreams run serially across turns instead of together.
- **Flailing.** Retrying a failing approach unchanged, or guessing when reading the code or docs would have settled it. An abandoned path only counts against the agent when the information to avoid it was already available.
- **Verification timing.** Checks run once, early enough to catch a defect before handoff, not deferred until after or re-run redundantly.

**Reason**

One to three sentences naming the dominant source of waste with a rough count (three review cycles, four redundant reads, two repeated user corrections), and the likely fixable cause — a missing skill, an ambiguous playbook step, a late check.
