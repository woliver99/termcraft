**Rubric**

This scorer covers both facets of "did the agent do the job it was assigned": fulfilling its factory role's entrypoint playbook (triage, spec, implementation, review, or foreman) and following the explicit directives, corrections, and constraints it received from the user or its orchestrating agent. Judge primarily on outcome — did the agent deliver what its role and its instructions both call for? Judge against the playbook and directives the transcript shows the agent actually had, not an idealized process. The bullets below are common ways either facet goes unmet, not an exhaustive checklist — judge any other way the mandate went unfulfilled too.

Assess:

- **Role fulfillment.** Did the agent produce what its entrypoint playbook says the role exists to produce, to a standard the next step can build on — not just go through the motions?
- **Directive coverage.** Every directive from the task prompt or later messages acted on, including ones stated once or buried in a longer message — not just the first part of a multi-part request.
- **Completeness.** Carried to the end, or stopped at the first plausible resting point (some issues triaged, some criteria specified, some of the diff reviewed)?
- **Scope.** Did what was asked and no more. Unrequested refactors, extra files, and self-assigned follow-on work are violations even when the extra work is good.
- **Required artifacts.** Delivered in the expected place and shape — spec doc, pull request, review comments, tracker state. Work that exists only in the agent's own transcript isn't delivered.
- **Hard constraints and gates.** Explicit prohibitions ("don't push", "ask before X", "draft PR only") carry the most weight, as do playbook gates: not self-approving its own output, and not advancing the loop past work it doesn't own or taking over a downstream role instead of finishing its own.
- **Bad instructions.** An ambiguous, wrong, or impossible directive should be surfaced with a defensible path taken — not silently reinterpreted or dropped.
- **Corrections.** Adopted promptly and completely; reverting to already-corrected behavior is a serious failure.
- **Truthful reporting and resumability.** The final report matches what was actually done — claiming untested or unfinished work as complete is a failure here, not a communication one — and state is left where the next agent or the user will actually look for it.

Out of scope: craftsmanship of the output (scored under Code Quality), and standing rules or skill requirements (scored under Procedure Compliance). Judge whether the assigned job — by role and by instruction — was done.

**Reason**

One to three sentences naming whether the gap was in the role mandate, the instructions, or both, quoting the playbook expectation or directive at issue. If unfulfilled, name what would have prevented it — a clearer playbook, a missing tool, a clearer instruction, an earlier check. For `insufficient_evidence`, say exactly what role, playbook, or directive context was missing.
