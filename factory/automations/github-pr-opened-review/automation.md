A pull request was opened, reopened, or marked ready for review. Run the review stage for it.

- Skip drafts, bot-authored PRs, and PRs the factory has already reviewed at this revision.
- ALWAYS dispatch the review stage for a human-authored, non-draft PR — external contributors included. Do not skip or defer the review because a linked issue is missing or ungated.
- For a PR from an external contributor, additionally check its linked same-repo issue(s) for the `ready-to-implement` (or `ready-to-spec` for spec-only PRs) gate label:
  - If no linked issue carries the required gate label, include a short fixed workflow note in the review body — the PR needs a linked issue marked by a maintainer before it can merge — and weigh this toward a changes-requested verdict. This note is IN ADDITION to the full review findings, never a replacement for them.
- Post the resulting review on the PR, then route it to the owning maintainer via the ownership map (`.github/STAKEHOLDERS`) and request their review.
- Apply the daily review budget for external contributors (at most 5 factory review passes per PR per day).
- Never merge, approve for merge, or close a PR. The review is advisory; merging is a human decision.
